**Problem Statement:**

This project aims to help the Ministry of Education in providing information to the schools in each State on what curriculum should they be offering to best cater to the interest of high school students.

**Data Dictionary:**

|State|object|ACT|States that have data for 2017 to 2019 (50 unique States in total)|
|Participant|float|ACT|Number of people doing the test from the population of those States|
|Composite|float|ACT|Average total score from 4 test in ACT of test takers from those States|
|Year|int|ACT|The Year in which data was collect (2017, 2018, 2019)|
|State|object|SAT|States that have data for 2017 to 2019 (51 unique States in total)|

**Analysis**

Overall increase in participation rate for SAT and decrease in participation rate for ACT.

13 states make it compulsory for students to take ACT test for all 3 years, while 3 states for make it compulsory for SAT test.

Many students do both exams to get the best one for entering desired universities. Seems like students are under increasing pressure to take both tests.

3 states have more than 50% participation rate for both tests.

A high participation rate or 100% rate does not yield the highest scores and it applies to both tests.

**Conclusion**

There is an increase in overall participation rate for SAT test

When looking at individual states, there are few states that have many it compulsory for students to take one of the tests.

States with high participation rate, does not always yield a high score on the test

For an example state like New York, participation rate for SAT test  has increased a lot compared to decline in participation rate for ACT test, however, scores do not change by much.

Every state has students taking both test, thus increasing expenses for parents. 

Since the total scores for each exam is made of a combination of different test, the scores could be significantly higher on one test compared to the other. 

**Recommendations**

Check to see the previous performance for SAT and ACT in your state. Compare the findings with the nations to set a benchmark for the school.

Make it compulsory that every student has to do a practice test for both ACT and SAT to determine the position of the student.

Conduct a survey and keep track of results of the following:

The interest of students - particular majors and universities

Keep track of schools academic performance on subjects that relate to these test

Make a comparison on similar test like SAT Math and ACT Math to see the level where the students are at.
